title: About Ryan

Ryan Price is a software developer, 'DevOps engineer', 'data scientist', and
several other buzzwords that he hates to be associated with. He currently works
at Slalom Consulting in St. Louis, MO, USA.

His formal education is in economics, finance, and statistics (econometrics, and
theoretical), which formed the often-ironic basis of his current career in
software. He loves all things automation, and usually falls asleep reading
documentation on open-source tools that facilitate that.

He is very fond of video games, and all other things software-related. He lives
in a St. Louis suburb with his fiancee Sabrina, dog William, cat Tibble, and
cockatiel Peach.
